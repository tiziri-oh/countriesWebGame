# geojson-world
GeoJSON files of all Capitals and Countries of the world.

I could'n find any valid geoJSON files of the world capitals or the shapes of the world countries, so I converted the data I found into two valid geoJSON files.

### capitals.geojson
This file contains all capitals of the world with coordinates type 'Point'.

### countries.geojson
This file contains the shapes of all countries of the world as type 'Polygon' or 'MultiPolygon'.


## Data Credits
I took the original data from:

Geojson World Capitals: http://www.geognos.com/geo/en/world-countries-API.html

Geojson Polygons World Countries: https://github.com/mledoze/countries/tree/master/data
